1) The <img> element is used to display an image. Let us try to display an image:
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSynzR8yXOh5svmSjLAK0j3OQDLZd7SK4h2suOKcmkaJg&s">

2) alt in img Tag:
The img tag has something important called alt. 
We use alt in an img tag to describe the image. This is particularly useful in situations when our image is not properly loaded on the screen.
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b9721aee-1c09-4d0c-9bcb-8969afe2751e/-/resize/400x/" alt="The view from a balcony">
<img src="broken-link.jpg" alt="The view from a plane">

3) Links
The <a> element is used to create a link to a web page. Here are some examples:
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">Giant Pandas are interesting!</a>
</p>

4) Creating links with HTML Elements

5) Attributes
In the code example given below, we add this attribute to an <h1> element with the value The 
web loves HTML. So, take your mouse cursor over the heading text in the result, and within a
second, you'll see the title attribute in action.

<h1 title="The web loves HTML">On the internet, HTML is everywhere</h1>
Output: 
On the internet, HTML is everywhere
If you take the cursor on the above output will see that "the web loves HTML"

Similarly, for image: src, alt is the attribute, and for linking (a) it is href
