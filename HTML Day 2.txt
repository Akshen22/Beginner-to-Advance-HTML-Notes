1) The <img> element is used to display an image. Let us try to display an image:
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSynzR8yXOh5svmSjLAK0j3OQDLZd7SK4h2suOKcmkaJg&s">

2) alt in img Tag:
The img tag has something important called alt. 
We use alt in an img tag to describe the image. This is particularly useful in situations when our image is not properly loaded on the screen.
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b9721aee-1c09-4d0c-9bcb-8969afe2751e/-/resize/400x/" alt="The view from a balcony">
<img src="broken-link.jpg" alt="The view from a plane">

3) Links
