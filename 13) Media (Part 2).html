* iFrame:
a) An <iframe> or "inline frame" is an HTML element that can load another HTML page inside an HTML page. 
iframe is mostly used for maps, advertisements, embedded videos, and other interactive content.

Example 1:
<div style="width: 100%">
    <iframe
      src="https://google.com/"
      width="100%" height="360">
    </iframe>
</div>

Example 2 (Map):
<div style="width: 100%">
      <iframe
        width="100%" height="360" title="BigBinary Pune"
        src="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=+(Big%20binary%20)&amp;output=embed">
      </iframe>
</div>  

b) The most commonly used attributes are width, height, title, and src. Let's look at them in detail:
width: Frame width in pixels.
height: Frame height in pixels.
title: sets the title of the frame.
src: path or the URL that needs to be embedded.  

c) Security concerns of iFrame:  
Iframe is a great tool to share content from other websites. There are many security reasons and some websites don't allow loading them inside an iframe.
One such security concern is iframe phishing where hackers try to manipulate you to key in your credentials to an iframe instead of the actual website, to steal your credentials. 
That is why some websites like banks etc. don't allow loading in an iframe.
