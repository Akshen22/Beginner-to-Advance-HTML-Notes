Table:
The <table> element is used to display data in a table consisting of rows and columns.

The following elements are used to arrange the data within a <table> element:

1) <table> element is used to display data in a table consisting of rows and columns.
2) <caption>Students</caption> (title)
3) The <thead> element is used to organize the header row of a table.
It doesn't change anything in the table, but it can contain the whole header row and gives your 
code a good structure.
4) <tr> - It is used to add a table row.
5) <th> in place of <td> for making a header row.
6) <td> - It is used to add information in a table row.
7) <tfoot> - used to organize the footer row of a table.
Suppose you make a table having various rows and columns of expenses and want to see the total, at the time it's used.
8) <tbody> - The <tbody> element is used to organize the body of a table for all the values inside the table.

Example:
<table>
 <caption>Students</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Gender</th>
  </tr>
 </thead>

  <tbody>
  <tr>
