* Render image:
a) A <picture> tag can give developers flexibility for working with images; small screen: small pic, medium screen: medium image, large: large.
b) The <source> tag is used to specify the available file sources, it is used in <picture>, <audio>, and <video> tags as well.

Example 1: 
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 550px)" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Colibr%C3%AD_Cola_de_Oro_%28Golden-tailed_Sapphire_Hummingbird%29_Bigger_File.jpg">
  <source media="(max-width: 780px)" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/RubyThroatedHummingbird.jpg">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Canivet%27s_emerald.jpg" alt="picture of hummingbird flying" width="100%">
</picture>

In the above example, we have 3 different bird images. The first one will be displayed when the available width is 0 pixels to 550 pixels. 
The second image is displayed when the available width is 551 pixels to 780 pixels.
Depending on the width of the screen, the image with the best-suited resolution gets rendered.

Example 2:
<picture>
  <img
  src="https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/Course/BigbinaryAcademy/cat-image_UWjT0OwWf.jpg"
  alt="a cat lying"
  width="300"
  height="200"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async">
  <source srcset="https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/Course/BigbinaryAcademy/cat-image_6-z1w9nxo.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/Course/BigbinaryAcademy/cat-image_UWjT0OwWf.jpg" type="image/webp">
</picture>

New image formats like avif and webp are not supported by old browsers. Here the browser renders the first supported image file format it encounters. 
Thus, having multiple source files also ensures that older browsers are also supported.

* Audio:
A <audio> tag simply creates a player on a webpage to play audio files of various formats, like wav, ogg and mp3.
There are few important attributes of a <audio> tag:
src: This attribute accepts a valid URL specifying the content source as a string.
controls: We must provide the controls attribute for player to get displayed. As by default <audio> player remains invisible.
autoplay: autoplay is used to play the audio automatically as soon as the page loads.
muted: This loads the player with the audio muted.
loop: Plays the audio on a loop, unless paused.
  
Example: 
<audio src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Hip_hop_Beatmix.ogg" controls autoplay muted loop></audio>
