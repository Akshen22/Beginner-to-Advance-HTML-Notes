Semantic HTML just means using the appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose. 
Using Javascript and HTML, we can turn any element into any other element Many developers do use divs for everything from headers to buttons. 
However, using semantic HTML as much as possible when writing HTML is important.

* Semantic HTML has many benefits:
1) Web Accessibility: Allows people with disabilities of any kind to use your site better using tools such as a screen reader
2) Great for SEO: Having alt text in image tags or descriptive headings in header tags will help search engines find your site if the content is relevant to the user.
3) Smaller file size: Having pre-built functionality means you have less custom code bulking up your file size. Helps mobile users and general responsiveness.
4) Easier to read: Other programmers won't have to dig through scripts and styles to find out what every multipurpose div does.

Try and use <button>Click</button> rather than <div className="button">Click</div>.
Using <button>Click</button> helps as a screen reader will identify it as a button, it is focusable via keyboard and it supports key actions like Enter and Space.
These are a lot of features being added by default along with some in-built styles that you can easily override with a bit of HTML.

* Already the one we are using:
<a></a> | <button></button> | <select></select> <input>

* Most Common Semantic HTML tags:
Header | Main | Nav | Section | Article | Aside | Footer

1) Header:
A header is a simple way to organize your HTML, at the top of the website. You can put elements like your website's navigation bar or the introductory section for the website inside it.
In the following example, we include the navigation bar of our website inside the header tag:
Example:
<body>
  <header>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="/products">Products</a></li>
      <li><a href="/career">Career</a></li>
    </ul>
  </header>
</body>

2) Main:
The main tag is used to hold all our major content on the web page.
Take a look at the following example:
<header>
  <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <img src="#" alt="image description">
	<h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
	<p>lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum</p>
</main>
 
3) Section:
Suppose you have lots of data to be put inside the main but there are lots of part!
So will use, <section></section>!

Example:
<header>
  <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <img src="#" alt="image description">
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
    <p>lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum</p>
  </section>
</main>

4) Footer:
A footer is a simple way to organize some of our HTML. Stuff that goes down below in our web page, like address, copyright information, we can put in a footer.
Example:
<header>
  <h1>The World Awaits its heroes!</h1>
</header>
<div>
  <h2>Is everyone fine on the spaceship?</h2>
  <p>There have been rumors about the safety of the space pilots.</p>
  <img src="">
  <p>We need to ensure that no harm comes to these people.</p>
</div>
<footer>

</footer>
