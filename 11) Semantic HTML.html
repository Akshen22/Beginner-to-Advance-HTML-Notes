Semantic HTML just means using the appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose. 
Using Javascript and HTML, we can turn any element into any other element Many developers do use divs for everything from headers to buttons. 
However, using semantic HTML as much as possible when writing HTML is important.

* Semantic HTML has many benefits:
1) Web Accessibility: Allows people with disabilities of any kind to use your site better using tools such as a screen reader
2) Great for SEO: Having alt text in image tags or descriptive headings in header tags will help search engines find your site if the content is relevant to the user.
3) Smaller file size: Having pre-built functionality means you have less custom code bulking up your file size. Helps mobile users and general responsiveness.
4) Easier to read: Other programmers won't have to dig through scripts and styles to find out what every multipurpose div does.

Try and use <button>Click</button> rather than <div className="button">Click</div>.
Using <button>Click</button> helps as a screen reader will identify it as a button, it is focusable via keyboard and it supports key actions like Enter and Space.
These are a lot of features being added by default along with some in-built styles that you can easily override with a bit of HTML.

* Already the one we are using:
<a></a> | <button></button> | <select></select> <input>

* Most Common Semantic HTML tags:
Header | Nav | Main | Section | Article | Aside | Footer

1) Header:
A header is a simple way to organize your HTML, at the top of the website. You can put elements like your website's navigation bar or the introductory section for the website inside it.
In the following example, we include the navigation bar of our website inside the header tag:
Example:
<body>
  <header>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="/products">Products</a></li>
      <li><a href="/career">Career</a></li>
    </ul>
  </header>
</body>

2) Nav:
The nav element is used to store a group of navigation links for our website.
Like: Home | About | Career
Example:
<header>
  <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/Course/BigbinaryAcademy/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2_bWpcbL-2Ko.svg">
  <nav>
    <ul class="nav">
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Products</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Career</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>

</header>
<main>
  <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/Course/BigbinaryAcademy/zanskar-river-ladakh_Y-rL9FsDb.jpg">
  <p>Welcome to our website! Explore our exciting products and learn more about our company's values and career opportunities.</p>
</main>

3) Main:
The main tag is used to hold all our major content on the web page.
Take a look at the following example:
<header>
  <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <img src="#" alt="image description">
	<h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
	<p>lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum</p>
</main>
 
4) Section:
Suppose you have lots of data to be put inside the main but there are lots of part!
So will use, <section></section>!

Example 1:
<header>
  <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <img src="#" alt="image description">
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
    <p>lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum</p>
  </section>
</main>

Example 2:
<section id="france">
  <h1>France</h1>
  <p>
    France is known for its rich culture, delicious cuisine, and iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="japan">
  <h1>Japan</h1>
  <p>
    Japan is a country of traditions, with a unique blend of modern technology and ancient customs. It's famous for sushi, cherry blossoms, and Mount Fuji.
  </p>
</section>

5) Article:
An article element stores the content that can be grouped together.
For example, a heading about a news item, an image about that piece of news and paragraph tags with all the text for that news can be grouped inside an article tag.
Look at the following example:
<article>
  <h2>A new sun rises for the endangered frog species</h2>
  <p>
    A sudden increase in funding for the efforts to sustain the endangered frog species of the world has brought new life to the whole program.
    <a href="#">Read More</a>
  </p>

</article>

6) Aside:
The <main> tag is used to group major content. But sometimes, we may have slightly related content that cannot be added in the major content. 
For example, how should we add a funny-related commentary alongside a serious article?
In such cases, we can use the <aside> tag:
Example:
<header>
  <h1>Space Exploration: The Final Frontier</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <article>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Space is mind-blowing. It's so vast that even GPS gets lost. And don't get me started on black holes – they're like cosmic vacuum cleaners, but without the annoying cord you trip over.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <h2>The Importance of Space Exploration</h2>
    <p>Space exploration has opened up new horizons for humanity.</p>
    <p>
      Space exploration has seen several historical milestones, starting with the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the Soviet Union in 1957. This event marked the beginning of the space age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a space race during the Cold War era. This competition led to significant achievements, including the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin) and the Apollo moon landings.
    </p>

7) Span:
Imagine we have a piece of writing, such as a story or a paragraph.
Occasionally, we might want to draw attention to or separate a particular part of that text, like a word or a sentence, to make it more noticeable compared to the rest of the text.
The <span></span> tag acts like a special marker that we can place around that specific part of the sentence or word. 
It allows us to apply a different style to that marked portion, such as changing its color, font, or background.
Let us take a look at an example 1:
<p>This is how we use <span>span</span>.</p>
->in the output, the word: 'span' is highlighted!

Example 2:
<h1>Welcome to <span class="highlight">Disneyland!</span></h1>
	
8) Footer:
A footer is a simple way to organize some of our HTML. Stuff that goes down below on our web page, like address, copyright information, we can put in a footer.
Example:
<header>
  <h1>The World Awaits its heroes!</h1>
</header>
<div>
  <h2>Is everyone fine on the spaceship?</h2>
  <p>There have been rumors about the safety of the space pilots.</p>
  <img src="">
  <p>We need to ensure that no harm comes to these people.</p>
</div>
<footer>

</footer>

9) Writing Good alt text:
A good alt text is a brief and descriptive summary of an image. It should provide relevant details and context of the image.
A bad alt text lacks information, duplicates existing text, or provides inaccurate or unrelated descriptions.
