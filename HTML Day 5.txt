1) Form Element
An HTML form is used to collect information that the user submits. The HTML <form> element can nest other elements like input, label, textarea, button, etc. inside it to represent different parts of a form.
Example:
<form>
  <input placeholder="Enter your name here">
  <button type="button">Submit</button>
</form>

2) Label Element
The <label> element puts a label on other form elements. In the example given below, <label> helps the user understand the purpose of the <input> element.
Example:
<form>
  <label>Name:</label>
  <input>
</form>

3) Placeholder
Placeholder text is the text that appears in an input field before the user clicks it and starts typing. Placeholder text disappears as soon as the user starts typing.
Example:
<form>
  <label>Full Name:</label>
  <input placeholder="Sam Smith">
</form>
