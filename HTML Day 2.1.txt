1) The <img> element is used to display an image. Let us try to display an image:
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSynzR8yXOh5svmSjLAK0j3OQDLZd7SK4h2suOKcmkaJg&s">

2) alt in img Tag:
The img tag has something important called alt. 
We use alt in an img tag to describe the image. This is particularly useful in situations when our image is not properly loaded on the screen.
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b9721aee-1c09-4d0c-9bcb-8969afe2751e/-/resize/400x/" alt="The view from a balcony">
<img src="broken-link.jpg" alt="The view from a plane">

3) Links
The <a> element creates a link to a web page. Here are some examples:
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">Giant Pandas are interesting!</a>
</p>

4) Links: Target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where the linked document will open.
The target attribute accepts the following values:
a) _self: This is the default value. It opens the linked document in the same window where the link was clicked.
b) _blank: Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.

6) Attributes
In the code example given below, we add this attribute to an <h1> element with the value The 
web loves HTML. So, take your mouse cursor over the heading text in the result, and within a
second, you'll see the title attribute in action.

<h1 title="The web loves HTML">On the internet, HTML is everywhere</h1>
Output: 
On the internet, HTML is everywhere
If you take the cursor on the above output will see that "the web loves HTML"

Similarly, for image: src, alt is the attribute, and for linking (a) it is href

7) class & id attributes: (specifically for CSS & JavaScript)
<p class="countries" id="malaysia">
  Malaysia
</p>

`<p>`: This is an HTML tag used to define a paragraph element. It is a block-level element, meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

`class="countries"`: This is the class attribute of the `<p>` tag. It assigns the class name 
"countries" to the paragraph element. Classes are used to apply CSS styles or JavaScript 
behaviors to elements. In this case, the class "countries" might be used to style all 
paragraphs related to countries in a specific way.

`id="malaysia"`: This is the id attribute of the `<p>` tag. It assigns the id "malaysia" to 
the paragraph element. IDs are used to uniquely identify elements within an HTML document. 
Unlike classes, which can be used multiple times, IDs should be unique within a document.

`Malaysia`: This is the text content of the paragraph element. It simply displays the text 
"Malaysia" on the webpage.

In summary, `<p class="countries" id="malaysia">Malaysia</p>` creates a paragraph element with 
the class "countries" and the id "malaysia", displaying the text "Malaysia" as the content of 
the paragraph. This element can be styled using CSS or targeted with JavaScript using its class 
or id.
