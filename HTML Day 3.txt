Table:
The <table> element is used to display data in a table consisting of rows and columns.

The following elements are used to arrange the data within a <table> element:

1) <tr> - It is used to add a table row.
2) <td> - It is used to add information in a table row.
3) <caption>Students</caption>
4) The <thead> element is used to organize the header row of a table.
It doesn't change anything in the table, but it can contain the whole header row and gives your 
code a good structure.
5) <th> in place of <td> for making a header row.
6) <tfoot>
