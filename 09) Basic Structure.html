1) <!DOCTYPE>: 
A special element that is added only at the top of the document. It provides information about the type of HTML used in the document. 
Syntax:
<!DOCTYPE html>

2) The HTML Element: 
The <html> element is the main element, which acts as the container for all the other elements, except the <!DOCTYPE> element. 
The <head> and <body> elements are placed inside the <html> element.
Syntax:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>

3) Declaring Language:
We should always use the language attribute in the <html> tag to declare the language of the Web page. 
This helps search engines deliver relevant content and browsers translate or style snippets of text accordingly.
The language property is inherited by all the children underneath it. 
Thus, adding the tag to the <body> element means the text in the head won't be covered.
Syntax: We can specify English as the language, like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html language="en">
  <body>
    <!-- rest of the content -->
  </body>
</html>

4) If the page contains content in a different language, just add the language attribute to an element surrounding that content like this:
<p>This is <span language="fr">une baguette française</span></p>
<p>This is <span language="de">eine deutsche Wurst</span></p>
<p>This is <span language="hi">एक भारतीय मिठाई</span></p>

5) Head Element:
The <head> element is used for specifying additional information about your webpage. 
Information such as which fonts to use, which JavaScript or CSS files to link to, what is the title of the page, etc.
Below are a few important elements that help store this information:
<title> element, which is used to set the title of the web page. This is displayed in the browser's title bar or page tab.
<link> element, which is used to add external resources, such as CSS files.
<script> element, which is used to embed JavaScript code.
<a/> <!-- Empty tag to end list -->
Syntax:
<head>
    <title>A Head element is a powerful thing!</title>
</head>
  
6) Body Element:
The <body> element contains the HTML elements that are used to display the contents of the web page, such as headings, images, paragraphs, links etc. 
There can be only one <body> tag within an HTML document.
Syntax:
<body>
</body>  

7) Document Structure:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

8) Comments:
Comments are great! Comments can help explain your work to other coders and even to your future self.
Comments do not get shown in the actual webpage. Although your comments can contain anything you want, yet it is recommended that you keep them precise and helpful.
For writing a comment use the syntax: <!-- text --> 
Example:
a) multi-line comment:
<!--
This is a multi-line comment.
This will not show in the result.
-->

b) single-line comment:
<!-- Single Line comment: This will also not be visible in the result. -->
