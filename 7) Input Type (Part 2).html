12) Input Type - File:
The <input type="file"> element defines a file-select field along with a "Browse" button.
This element lets the user choose files from their device's storage.

Example:
<form>
  <input type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" placeholder="image.png/image.jpeg" multiple><br>
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>

In the above  example, inputs of type file also support the following attributes:
The "accept attribute" is a string that defines the file types this input should accept.
To define a file-select field that allows multiple files to be selected, add the multiple attribute.
