* Dialog element:
The <dialog> element is used to create a pop-up window, which is called a dialog box.
By default, the dialog box is hidden and not displayed. To make the dialog box visible, we need to add an open attribute to the <dialog> element.

Let us have a look at an example:
<dialog open>
  <p>This is a basic dialog box.</p>
</dialog>
